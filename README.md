# Ray Tracing Project - A Flurry of Grace

A custom ray tracer implementing fundamental computer graphics concepts including lighting, shadows, and reflections using Python and PyGame.

## Overview
This project demonstrates core graphics principles:
- Light and shadow calculation using the Law of Reflections
- Vector mathematics and linear algebra for 3D rendering
- Implementation of diffuse and specular lighting models
- Perspective projection and camera transformations

## Technical Implementation
- Parametric equations for ray-object intersections
- Matrices and transformations for 3D geometry
- Anti-aliasing for improved render quality
- RGB color space management
- Field of view and aspect ratio handling

## Features
- Ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
- Shadow ray computation
- View frustum management
- Particle system integration
- Basic collision detection

- Environment mapping
- Texture support
- Advanced camera effects

- ## Development Tools
- Python
- Custom vector/matrix operations
- Procedural texture generation
- Video editing software (OpenShot)
